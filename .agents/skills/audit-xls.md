description: Audit a spreadsheet for formula accuracy, errors, and common mistakes. Scopes to a selected range, a single sheet, or the entire model including financial-model integrity checks (BS balance, cash tie-out, logic sanity). Triggers on "audit this sheet", "check my formulas", "find formula errors", "QA this spreadsheet", "debug model", "model won't balance", "model review".

# Audit Spreadsheet

Audit formulas and data for accuracy and mistakes. Scope determines depth — from quick formula checks on a selection up to full financial-model integrity audits.

## Step 1: Determine Scope

If the user already gave a scope, use it. Otherwise **ask them**:

> What scope do you want me to audit?
> - **selection** — just the currently selected range
> - **sheet** — the current active sheet only
> - **model** — the whole workbook, including financial-model integrity checks (BS balance, cash tie-out, roll-forwards, logic sanity)

The **model** scope is the deepest — use it for DCF, LBO, 3-statement, merger, comps, or any integrated financial model before sending to a client or IC.

## Step 2: Formula-Level Checks (ALL Scopes)

| Check | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Formula errors | `#REF!`, `#VALUE!`, `#N/A`, `#DIV/0!`, `#NAME?` |
| Hardcodes inside formulas | `=A1*1.05` — the `1.05` should be a cell reference |
| Inconsistent formulas | Formula that breaks the pattern of its neighbors |
| Off-by-one ranges | SUM/AVERAGE that misses the first or last row |
| Pasted-over formulas | Cell that looks like a formula but is actually a hardcoded value |
| Circular references | Intentional or accidental |
| Broken cross-sheet links | References to cells that moved or were deleted |
| Unit/scale mismatches | Thousands mixed with millions, % stored as whole numbers |
| Hidden rows/tabs | Could contain overrides or stale calculations |

---

## Step 3: Model-Integrity Checks (MODEL Scope Only)

Identify the model type (DCF / LBO / 3-statement / merger / comps) and run the appropriate checks.

### 3a. Structural Review

| Check | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Input/formula separation | Are inputs clearly separated from calculations? |
| Color convention | Blue=input, black=formula, green=link — applied consistently? |
| Tab flow | Logical order (Assumptions → IS → BS → CF → Valuation)? |
| Date headers | Consistent across all tabs? |
| Units | Consistent (thousands vs millions vs actuals)? |

### 3b. Balance Sheet

| Check | Test |
|---|---|
| BS balances | Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Equity (every period) |
| RE rollforward | Prior RE + Net Income − Dividends = Current RE |

If BS doesn't balance, **quantify the gap per period and trace where it breaks** — nothing else matters until this is fixed.

### 3c. Cash Flow Statement

| Check | Test |
|---|---|
| Cash tie-out | CF Ending Cash = BS Cash (every period) |
| CF sums | CFO + CFI + CFF = Δ Cash |
| D&A match | D&A on CF = D&A on IS |
| CapEx match | CapEx on CF matches PP&E rollforward on BS |
| WC changes | Signs match BS movements (ΔAR, ΔAP, ΔInventory) |

### 3d. Income Statement

| Check | Test |
|---|---|
| Revenue build | Ties to segment/product detail |
| Tax | Tax expense = Pre-tax income × tax rate |
| Share count | Ties to dilution schedule |

### 3e. Logic & Reasonableness

| Check | Flag if |
|---|---|
| Growth rates | >100% revenue growth without explanation |
| Margins | Outside industry norms |
| Terminal value dominance | TV > ~75% of DCF EV |
| Hockey-stick | Projections ramp unrealistically in out-years |
| Edge cases | Model breaks at 0% or negative growth |

### 3f. Model-Type-Specific Bugs

**DCF:**
- Discount rate applied to wrong period (mid-year vs end-of-year)
- Terminal value not discounted back
- WACC uses book values instead of market values
- FCF includes interest expense (should be unlevered)
- Tax shield double-counted

**LBO:**
- Debt paydown doesn't match cash sweep mechanics
- PIK interest not accruing to principal
- Exit multiple applied to wrong EBITDA (LTM vs NTM)
- Fees/expenses not deducted from Day 1 equity

**Merger:**
- Accretion/dilution uses wrong share count (pre- vs post-deal)
- Synergies not phased in
- Foregone interest on cash not included

**3-statement:**
- Working capital changes have wrong sign
- Depreciation doesn't match PP&E schedule
- Debt maturity schedule doesn't match principal payments

## Step 4: Report

Output a findings table:

| # | Sheet | Cell/Range | Severity | Category | Issue | Suggested Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Severity:**
- **Critical** — wrong output (BS doesn't balance, formula broken, cash doesn't tie)
- **Warning** — risky (hardcodes, inconsistent formulas, edge-case failures)
- **Info** — style/best-practice (color coding, layout, naming)

For **model** scope, prepend a summary line:

> Model type: [DCF/LBO/3-stmt/...] — Overall: [Clean / Minor Issues / Major Issues] — [N] critical, [N] warnings, [N] info

**Don't change anything without asking** — report first, fix on request.

---

## Notes

- **BS balance first** — if it doesn't balance, everything downstream is suspect
- **Hardcoded overrides are the #1 source of silent bugs** — search aggressively
- **Sign convention errors** (positive vs negative for cash outflows) are extremely common
- If the model uses VBA macros, note any macro-driven calculations that can't be audited from formulas alone

---

## Command Workflow: /debug-model

Audit the specified financial model with **model** scope — check for broken formulas, balance sheet imbalances, hardcoded overrides, circular references, and logic errors.

If a file path is provided, use it. Otherwise ask the user for the model to review.
